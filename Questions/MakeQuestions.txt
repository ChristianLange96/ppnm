1. What is the Main method?
	The Main method calls the makefile in which it's directed what to do first, 
	what to use for that specific command. It makes sure that all the files 
	needed exist and are compiled before use.

2. What is source code, bytecode and executable code?
	Source code: The code that I write in the C#-language. 
	Bytecode: When the source code is compiled a bytecode-file is created.
	Executable: Software in a form that can be run directly on the computer.

3. How can you compile a C#-program which is wholly contained in one file,
   say hello.cs, into an executable bytecode?
	I call: mcs hello.cs

4. How do you run the resulting executable code with the mono runtime-system?
	I call: mono hello.exe

5. How can you compile the C# source code in the file cmath.cs into a bytecode libray
   cmath.dll?
	Not sure.

6. How can you link a bytecode library, say cmath.dll, when compiling your
   file with the Main method, say main.cs?
	I do that through the Makefile. I specify which .exe to run first, so by 
	default, it looks for the Main-method in that .exe.
