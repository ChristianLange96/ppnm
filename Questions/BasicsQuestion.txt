1.What is the mcs option to turn off all warnings?
-warn:0

2. What is the mcs option to turn off informational warnings?
-warn:3

3.Rewrite this piece of code, x=(a>b?a:b), using the if statement.
if(a>b)
	{x = a;}
else
	{x = b;}

4. If you need mathematical functions from, say, cmath.dll library, how do you link your program with the library?
	In the makefile:
	Give the flag -r:cmath.dll

5. What will the following piece of code print?
int i=0;
Write("{0}\n",i);
Write("{0}\n",i++);
Write("{0}\n",++i);
Explain.

The output print will be:
0
0
2

First it will write i, then it will write i and increment i once, and in the last line
it will increment before writing i, thus i=2 before the last 'Write'-command.

6. Rewrite the loop while(condition)body using the for loop.
for(init; condition; i++) {body}
This doesn't really make sense as the two scenarious are not comparable.


7. Rewrite the loop for(init;cond;inc)body using the while loop.
init;
while(cond)
 {body;
 inc;}

8. Rewrite the loop do body while(condition); using the for loop.
body;
for(condition) {body;}
Same 'problem' as in 6).
